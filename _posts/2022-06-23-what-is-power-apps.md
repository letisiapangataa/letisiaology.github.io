# What is Power Apps?

##### References

**[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/powerapps-overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/powerapps-overview)**

Power Apps is a suite of apps, services and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs. Using Power Apps, you can quickly build custom business apps that connect to your data stored either in the underlying data platform (Microsoft Dataverse) or in various online and on-premises data sources (such as SharePoint, Microsfot 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server and so on).

Apps built using Power Apps provide rich business logic and workflow capabilities to transform your manual business operations into digital, automated processes. What's more, apps built using Power Apps have a responsive design and can run seamlessly in browser and on mobile devices (phone or tablet). Power Apps "democratizes" the business-app-builsing experience by enabling users to create feature-rich, custom business apps without writing code.

Power Apps also provides an extensible platform that lets pro developers programmatically interact with data and meta data, apply business logic, create custom connectors, and integrate with external data.
