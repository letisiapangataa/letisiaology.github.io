# Let's Get Started with Microsoft Power Apps

Learning new technology can lead to serious procrastination, especially when you're focused on diving head-first into theory. At least, that's what I've learned personally and found that diving into the practicality of a piece of technology is my more ideal way to generate genuine interest and passion for software.

## Just develop that app and build that random idea!

Perfectionism is not the vibe. You won't find that perfect idea, you just become inspired and you build it. That ideal idea will come naturally as you build a natural inclination of wanting to solve problems with your new skill.

My individual advice, write it down once you're inspired and just build it! Start with small, doable ideas and slowly iterate and add new features into your application.

## Let's do it!

**1. Figure out what kind of app you're trying to build.**

Before we hack out an application, we need to figure out what kind of app we want to build to be able to identify the technical specifications for the application or if there is an available Power Apps template to build from.

Therefore, ask yourself, what kind of business process or business problem are you trying to solve or make more efficient?

What are the primary functions of the application do you want to build?

**2. Identify the Microsoft PowerApps.**
