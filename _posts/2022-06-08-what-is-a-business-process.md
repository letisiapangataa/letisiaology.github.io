A business process is a set of business tasks and activities that are performed by employees, customers or systems to produce an outcome that contributes to business goals.

Processes are plentiful in a business, as these are the tasks that essentially build an organization. Such examples are from onboarding new employees, vendor invoicing, sales, every business outcome is a result of repeatable tasks and activities.

These processes are executed strictly in documented guidelines, however, can be flexible. A business cannot function without proper execution of its business processes.

Once again a business process is a collection of business tasks and activities that when performed by people or systems in a structured course, produce an outcome that contributes to the business goals.

A business process includes at least one of, but not limited to, the following elements:

- Task / Activity
- System
- Employee(s)
- Workflow
- Data

Business processes are invented to derive and contribute to **organizational goals**.

The continuous and repeated execution of business processes is pivotal to successful business operations and business growth.

Business process structures can be simple or complex, based on the elemnts involved in the process. Through every business process, a business strives to achieve certain goals.

Some key attributes that distinguish business processes from other business tasks and activities are:

- A process is repeatable.
- A process is flexible and not fixed.
- A process is specific and has established steps, a start and an end.
- A process is measurable.

To understand this better, this is an example of the employee offboarding process which has the following steps:

- Acknowledging the resignation / termination.
- Negotiation with the employee for retainment.
- Notice period and final settlement procedures.
- Planning for pending projects and assigned tasks.
- Hand over and knowledge transfer of project and company details.
- Exit interview.

*These are the most common activities involved globally in an employee offboarding process. Through acknowledgment and negotiation discussions, the business tries to reason with and retain the employee.*

*The notice period and final settlement procedures help the employee and company get clarity on the terms of the contract pending after the resignation. The project planning and handover activities help the business make sure that daily processes are not affected due to the resignation of the employee.*

*Finally, the exit interview provides the business an opportunity to improve with detailed feedback on the company operations and policies.*


Business processes are the backbone of business operations, which is why improving them is of strategic value to your business. According to Gartner, implementing a business process management strategy increases the success rate of your projects by 70%.

Organizations around the globe are investing a significant amount of time and money to manage and improve their business processes.

Business processes are often confused with projects and procedures. Processes are finite, flexible and repeatable, and generate value post their execution. 

***Processes vs. Projects***

*A project is focused on creating something new or implementing a change, whereas a process is focused on creating value by repeatedly performing a task. Simply put, projects are activities that you have never performed in your business before, whereas processes are activities that you do repeatedly.*

*For example, making your daily cup of coffee is a process. You like to add the same ingredients in the same amount and make it every day. There are almost no chances of the taste going wrong, but if it does, I know how that bugs you!*

*But trying to make an Instagram trending coffee recipe from Korea isn't something you do every day. You are experimenting with new ingredients and methods, which make it a project. It is new, exciting, and you don't know how it is going to pan out.*

***Processes vs Procedures***

*A process is a flow of business activities that are connected toward the achievement of a business outcome, whereas a procedure is a prescribed way of undertaking a process or part of a process. While a process is a set of defined actions, a procedure is a set of instructions that are detailed in nature.*

*For instance, onboarding a new employee in your organization is a process. It is focused on introducing the company to the new person and familiarizing them with company policies, culture, and teams.*

*Whereas onboarding documentation is a procedure. It has a detailed set of instructions related to documents, signatures, and agreements.*

*To manage and improve your business processes, you must understand them better. Let us take a look at some more examples of business processes, their advantages, and context with other business practices.*
