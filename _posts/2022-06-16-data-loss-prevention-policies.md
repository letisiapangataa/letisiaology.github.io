Your organization's data is likely one of the most important assets you are responsible for safeguarding as an administrator.

The ability to build apps and automation to use that data is a large part of your company's success. You can use Power Apps and Power Automate for rapid build and rollout of these high-value apps so that users can measure and act on the data in real time.

Apps and automation are becoming increasingly connected across multiple data sources and multiple services. Some of these might be external, third-party services and might even include some social networks. Users generally have good intentions but they can easily overlook the potential for exposure from data leakage to services and audiences that should not have access to the data.
