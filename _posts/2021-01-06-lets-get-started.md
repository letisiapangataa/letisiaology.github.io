What am I working on? What am I doing? What am I up to?

*That's for me to know and for you to find out.*

In my past I've worked on mobile and tablet applications, I've also started, *for emphasis, started not succeeded* my own technology startup "Code Tutor" turned "Code Tutor ®" to "Code Tutor ® Education" which is a story on its own that I'd soon find the time to discuss how that has led into the project I am working on now.

In that case, besides serious startup projects, I plan to master major technologies and programming languages. To practice and master such skillset I'll be publishing small applications. I'd be sure to take notes of each significant issue.

There's plenty to look forward to and plenty of work to get done. I'm often under the radar with my strategies and work process, and believe that it's a wise action to do so. 

*We can never speak too soon and you never know who's watching.*
