What am I working on? What am I doing? What am I up to?

*That's for me to know and for you to find out.*

I'm currently working on an upcoming technology startup. In my past I've worked on mobile and tablet applications, I've also started my own technology startup "Code Tutor" turned "Code Tutor ®" to "Code Tutor ® Education" which is a story on its own that I'd soon find the time to discuss well into detail how that has led to the project I am working on now.

In that case, besides serious startup projects, I plan to master major technologies and programming languages. To practice and master such skillset I'll be publishing minor applications. I'd be sure to keep note of each major issue.

There's plenty to look forward to and plenty of work to get done. I'm often under the radar with my strategies and work process, and believe that it's wise to do so. Can never speak too soon and you never know who's watching. We'll speak soon.
