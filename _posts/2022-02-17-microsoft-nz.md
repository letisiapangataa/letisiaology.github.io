**New job, who's this?** - **Letisia Pangata'a**

I've started my position as a Cloud Solution Architect Intern at Microsoft NZ. 

Last week I was assigned a task to write up a subsidiary to introduce myself. I've attached it below so that others who visit my portfolio may have a fair grasp of who I am.
