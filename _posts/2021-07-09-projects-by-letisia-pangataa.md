I insist you check it out via the navigation bar above.

I've finally found the time in between my semester break to setup my **[Projects](https://letisiapangataa.github.io/projects/)** (check it out) page. I've always wanted to get all my work in documentation form to keep record on my projects.
 
 Now that we've got that out of the way, my [projects](https://letisiapangataa.github.io/projects/)  page takes note on the primary points that I've wanted to get across, from the technologies I've used to the minor technical complexities I've had to implement and work with.

 In the past, I've developed multiple applications, designed and developed an educational course program and experimented with a publishing startup, to be continued. If you read through, I've documented my successes and failures, which is just as important to the process and journey itself.
