Despite what could be perceived as an obvious, predictable failure, I've taken this as a highly regarded learning experience, specifically in how I choose to approach the publishing and distribution sector.

Under significant development stages during the startup process, I've implemented an online E-Commerce store, creatively designed and directed branding, marketing and product development material.
