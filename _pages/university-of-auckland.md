Despite, thoroughly enjoying and learning many complementary, advantageous knowledge that are fundamental to my practice of Computer Science and Information Systems, I've learned that I best perform at my most skilled when implementing my technology-based knowledge, technical skills, and creativity in varied practical ways.

My talent and skill sets can be showcased through problem solving, innovation, entrepreneurship, business analytics, creative directing, visual design, providing technical solutions and technology based initiatives.

During my time at University of Auckland, I've been involved in University of Auckland Summer Lab, Women in Computer Science, Auckland University Muay Thai Club, Auckland University Computer Science Society, Auckland University Strength Society and University of Auckland Women In Business.
