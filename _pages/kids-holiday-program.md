## Kids Holiday Program
### Coder Factory
 
During my time as a Teaching Assistant at the Coder Factory, I was assigned the task to develop a Kids Holiday Program focused on kids learning to code.

In my time, I was creatively inspired by my Kids Holiday Program that I've grown actively intrigued by the idea of implementing creativity and science together to improve young and mature educational experiences.

My Kids Holiday Program was an extensive course program, designed to assist the primary teacher in charge. In particular, this Kids Holiday Program focused on HTML5 Game development using the HTML5 Phaser framework.
