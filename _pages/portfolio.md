Over the trajectory of my career, I've developed and worked on many projects that showcase my skill sets and creativity, whether they're individual profitable works to startup and professional projects. 

Each project has provided me a set of challenges and accomplishments from project management, visual design and software development.

I've provided an overall list of projects I've worked on independently, collaboratively or academically (if noted) and listed a brief description of each product and project history, its successes and failures to its technology stack and specialized complex features.
