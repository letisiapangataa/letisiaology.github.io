Upcoming "graduate-to-be" at University of Auckland with a flair for creative arts, business and entrepreneurship to science and technology.

Inspired by my interests and Tongan heritage, focused on providing creative insight and current discipline in science, into personal and professional projects.

Mālō aupito’ from Aotearoa, New Zealand.
