Kia ora, I'm Letisia Pangata'a. Ko hoku hingoa ko Letisia Tatimoa Pangata'a. *(translation: My name is Letisia Tatimoa Pangata'a)*

I can be found in the wonders of Aotearoa, New Zealand. I am currently a Bachelors in Science student majoring in Computer Science and Information Systems.

I am mixed with a combination of Computer Programmer, Software Engineer, Technology Entrepreneur and Creative Designer. I enjoy thinking outside of the box into futuristic innovations.

My interests and passions vary from creative arts, business and entrepreneurship, to science and technology.
