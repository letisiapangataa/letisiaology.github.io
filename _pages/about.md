Kia ora, I'm Letisia.  I can be found in the wonders of Aotearoa, New Zealand. 

I am currently taking papers in Stage 2 and Stage 3 as a long-term student at University of Auckland. My interests and passions vary from creative arts, business and entrepreneurship, to science and technology.

For possible opportunities, feel free to contact me by [Email](mailto:lpan375@aucklanduni.ac.nz) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/letisiapangataa/).
