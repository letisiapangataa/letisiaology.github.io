My journey in academia has been far from easy, I'm often met with people who tend to put me on a pedalstal due to my pursuit in academia, but I'm extremely, extremely far from a perfect A+ student and have failed many classes in pursuing my degree program.

I've taken the wrong classes, failed a mandatory paper at its possible limit, stretched my Student Loan, switched my major multiple times, almost dropped out of University and opted to work instead. 

It has been a mental and emotional roller coaster in why I've chosen to persist and insist in pursuing my degree program.

I'm currently a 5+ year, part-time student at University of Auckland. Choosing to prioritize my well-being and the ability to pursue my studies at my own pace in addition to what can be a demeaning reputation of being a 5+ year, mature student has done wonders for my mental and emotional well-being as well as have maintained my passion that I've always had for software and technology.
