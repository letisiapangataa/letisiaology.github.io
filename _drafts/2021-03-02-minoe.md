# My lil' world.


I'm quite the diverse character, there are many sides, interests and passions that come with the type of person I am. You could call it complex, but I'd moreso refer to it as untraditional. For as long as I can remember, I've always tried to restrict and conform myself to fit into societal norms and expectations.

To the degree that I've found, that as I've grown older, it has been increasingly suffocating and dehumanising that I've finally given myself the permission to be who I want to be, like what I like and be passionate about things I want to be passionate about.
